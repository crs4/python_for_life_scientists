## Pandas

`pandas` is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. 

It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world **data analysis** in Python. 

Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language.
