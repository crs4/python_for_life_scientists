## Python is not a snake but a frequent thought 

+ Christmas holidays of 1989. Guido Van Rossum is bored, but instead of preparing the Christmas tree he starts to create a new programming language.

+ He called it Python because  he was a Monty Python fan and he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious

> Making references to Monty Python skits is not only allowed, it is encouraged!

## In this module we can learn:

+ What is Python

+ Why to choose Python

+ How to install Python

---

## What is Python?



Python is a high level programming language

+ interpreted 

+ interactive

+ object-oriented

---

## Interpreted Language

+ Programs are executed directly and freely, each line of code at a time

+ Programmer is able to see the results of their programs immediately

+ Any errors will result in the execution of the code to be halted

---

## Interactive Language

+ You can write instructions directly from its command prompt without needing to create or edit a source file

+ Prompt waits for commands from the user, which it executes and returns the result of the execution. <br>
After this the shell waits for the next input.

---

## Object Oriented Language

 + Combines data structures (`attributes`) with functions (`methods`) to create re-usable `objects`.
 
 + Objects interact each other by sending messages

## Why to choose Python

1. Simple Elegant Syntax

2. Not overly strict

3. Expressiveness of the language

4. Great Community and Support


---

## 1. Simple Elegant Syntax

+ Programming in Python is fun. 

+ It's easier to understand and write Python code: the syntax feels natural. 

Take this source code for an example:
```
a = 2
b = 3
sum = a + b
print(sum)
```

---

## 2. Not overly strict

+ You don't need to define the type of a variable in Python. 

+ It's not necessary to add semicolon at the end of the statement.

+ Python enforces you to follow good practices (like proper indentation). 

> ### These small things can make learning much easier for beginners.

---

## 3. Expressiveness of the language

+ Python allows you to write programs having greater functionality with fewer lines of code. 

+ You will be amazed how much you can do with Python once you learn the basics.

---

## 4. Great Community and Support

+ Python has a large supporting community. 

+ There are numerous active forums online which can be handy if you are stuck. 

Some of them are:

>+ [Learn Python subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/)
>
>+ [Google Forum for Python](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.lang.python)
>
>+ [Python Questions - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/python)

## How to install Python

The easiest way is by using `Conda`. 

+ **What is Conda?**
    
    + [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/)  is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. 

    + Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies.

---

>But you don’t just install conda per se. 
>
>Rather, you’ll install what might be analogized to a distribution
>
> Anaconda and Miniconda being the two.

---

## Anaconda

+ What is Anaconda?
    + [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) is a free and open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications that aims to simplify package management and deployment.
  
    + At the core, Anaconda uses conda package management system.

---

## Miniconda

+ What is Miniconda?

    + [Miniconda]() is a free minimal installer for conda. 
    
    + Miniconda is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only:
        + conda
        + Python
        + the packages they depend on 
        + a small number of other useful packages

---

## Installing Python

+ Navigate to the Miniconda download page: [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
+ Select the Python 3.6 installer

---

## Installing Python on Windows

+ Run the installer: double-click the `.exe` file.
+ Follow the instructions on the screen.
    + If you are unsure about any setting, accept the defaults. You can change them later.

---

+ If the installation has worked, you should now have a new program called `Anaconda Prompt` available in the start menu.

<img src="{{site.url}}/img/miniconda-prompt.png" alt="miniconda-prompt" style="width:300px;"/>

---

+ Click on the “Anaconda Prompt” icon to launch a new command prompt window. 
You should see something like this:

<img src="{{site.url}}/img/miniconda-prompt-1.png" alt="miniconda-prompt-1" style="width:700px;"/>

If you’ve never seen a command prompt before<br> don’t be scared.<br>
It is basically a way of talking directly to your computer. <br>

> To use the command prompt, type a command and then press the return key.

---

## Test your Installation

```
conda --help
```
