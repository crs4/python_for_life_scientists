# Python<br>for<br>Life Scientists
## Managing biological data with Python

--

## Getting started


Why are we here?

What are your expectations?

What do you need programming for?

What would you like to take home from the course?

--

## In this course you will learn to:

+ Read text files 
+ Selectively extract and manipulate information
+ Manage tabular data
+ Manage sequence data
+ Use libraries
+ PROGRAM!

*At the end of this course you won’t be expert programmers, but “high level beginners”*

> ##### Therefore your future as programmers strongly depends on your will to not stop programming when you go back home
